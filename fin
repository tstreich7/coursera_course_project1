            <h2>Stocks</h2>

                <li>Common stocks grant voting rights and potential dividends.</li>
                <li>Preferred stocks usually offer fixed dividends but limited voting rights.</li>

            <h2>Cryptocurrencies</h2>
            <p>Cryptocurrencies are digital assets that use blockchain technology to ensure security and decentralization. Unlike traditional currencies, they are not controlled by any central authority.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Bitcoin (BTC) - The first and most well-known cryptocurrency.</li>
                <li>Ethereum (ETH) - A blockchain supporting smart contracts and decentralized applications.</li>
                <li>Stablecoins - Cryptos pegged to fiat currencies for reduced volatility.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)</h2>
            <p>ETFs are investment funds that track indices, commodities, or sectors. They provide diversification and are traded like stocks on exchanges.</p>
            <ul>
